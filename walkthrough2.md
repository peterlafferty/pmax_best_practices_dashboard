[Spotlight pointers](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/directives-spotlights#spotlight_pointers) let you select UI items:
* Spotlight id <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="cloud-shell-more-button" target="cloudshell">More Menu</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
* CSS selector (can't find the selector) <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="??????">Ephemeral button</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>.


. After the shell has loaded open
   <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="cloud-shell-more-button" target="cloudshell" title="Show me where">**More**</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>
   and select **Ephemeral** to preserve across sessions.
