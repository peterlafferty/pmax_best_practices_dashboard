Text locator: <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="text('Add or remove scopes')">Add or remove scopes</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>

Semantic text locator: <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer locator="semantic({button 'Add or remove scopes'})">Add or remove scopes</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>

CSS Selector: <walkthrough-spotlight-pointer cssSelector="button[type='button']">Add or remove scopes</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer> (mauybe xpath works?)
